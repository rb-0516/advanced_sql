Imagine you are planning a long holiday vacation to Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with trip planning, I conducted a climate analysis about the area. This challenge is divided into 2 parts: 1) Analyze and Explore the Climate Data and 2) Design a Climate App.

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore Climate Data

In this section I used Python and SQLAlchemy to conduct analysis and explore the climate database. Both precipitation analysis and station analysis were conducted.

## Part 2: Design a Climate App

In this section I designed a Flask API based on the queries in part 1.
